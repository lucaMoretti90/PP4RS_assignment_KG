\section{Introduction}

The National Basketball Association is a men's professional basketball
league in North America, composed of 30 teams. We analyze a dataset
of NBA players obtained from Kaggle.com
 ("https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats#player_data.csv") to
 obtain some interetsing findings.

In a game, every player is allowed 5 personal fouls per game.
These fouls can arrise from various reasons but in general entail
harming another player. We analyze the data on fouls to check the determinants
of fould and if there is a trend in the average fouls per game over the years.

From the source, we download two datasets. One is a cross-section dataset containing
the player characteristics for 3923 players. The other is a panel data
containing player statistics over time. We merge these two datasets to
obtain a balanced pane of 24961 observations over 68 years from 1950 through
2017.
